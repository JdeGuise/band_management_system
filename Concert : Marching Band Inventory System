Concert / Marching Band Inventory System

Goal : The goal of this project is to build a comprehensive dbms for a high school band program, with all inventory management considerations taken into effect.  

Bands can take different forms, such as marching band, pep band, jazz band, concert band, etc.  The system will act as the basis for creation of each of these bands, as instantiated objects containing all necessary properties (ie a band database system with subsystems for each band)
